# Tell FastAPI from bare Starlette by the 404 body — {"detail":"Not Found"} vs plain Not Found

To confirm from OUTSIDE that a deployed ASGI service is running **FastAPI** and not bare **Starlette**, hit a path that does not exist and look at the 404 body:

- FastAPI installs a default exception handler that returns JSON: `{"detail":"Not Found"}` (content-type application/json).
- Bare Starlette (routes assembled directly, no FastAPI) returns plain text `Not Found` (text/plain).

So `curl https://svc/__nope__` distinguishes them with no access to the code. Caveat: if the app has an auth middleware in front, an unauthenticated request is answered by the MIDDLEWARE (e.g. 401) before routing reaches the 404 handler — send a VALID credential so the request passes the middleware and actually reaches FastAPIs router, then read the 404 body.

Used to verify a Cloud Run redeploy: FastAPI 404 `{"detail":"Not Found"}` (with bearer) + the pinned image digest matching the just-built one + a live `message/send` returning a sensible reply = three independent proofs the new FastAPI revision is the one serving.
