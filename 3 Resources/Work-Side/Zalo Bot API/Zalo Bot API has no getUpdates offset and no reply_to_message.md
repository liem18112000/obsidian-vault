# Zalo Bot API has no getUpdates offset and no reply_to_message

The Zalo Bot API is Telegram-shaped but is missing two fields that Telegram bridges rely on, and each forces a design change when building a long-poll → resume integration:

**1. `getUpdates` has no `offset`/`update_id`.** You cannot acknowledge consumed updates by advancing an offset like Telegram. The server long-poll may redeliver. Mitigation: the client must dedupe itself — track processed `message_id`s in a bounded persisted set, and ignore any message whose `date` (epoch ms) is older than the poller start time so a fresh poller does not replay history.

**2. Incoming messages have no `reply_to_message`.** A user reply carries no reference to the bot message it answers, so you cannot map a reply back to a specific originating session the way the Telegram bridge does (message_id → session_id map). Mitigation: route every incoming message to the **most-recent** session instead — the forward hook overwrites a single `last-session.json` pointer on each Stop/Notification, and the poller resumes that. Provide an explicit escape hatch (e.g. a `/new <task>` command) to force a fresh session.

Discovered while building the `zalo-hook-installation` Claude Code skill (the Zalo sibling of [[telegram-hook-installation]]-style bridges). Contrast with Telegram, which has both `offset` and `reply_to_message`.
