# Earnings per Click

> [!summary]
> **Earnings per Click (EPC)** is the average commission an affiliate earns per click sent to an offer. It is the single best metric for **comparing affiliate offers**, because it folds the payout rate *and* the conversion rate (and, for %-based offers, [[Average Order Value]]) into one number.

## The formula

```
EPC = total commissions earned ÷ total clicks
```

Often quoted **per 100 clicks** (networks like ShareASale do this), so an "EPC of $45" may mean $45 per 100 clicks = $0.45 per click. Always check the basis.

## Why EPC beats comparing headline rates

A commission rate alone is misleading — it ignores how often clicks actually convert. EPC captures the whole chain:

```
EPC = conversion rate × payout per conversion
```

For a percentage [[Cost per Sale]] offer that expands to:

```
EPC = conversion rate × commission % × Average Order Value
```

> [!tip] EPC is the great equaliser
> - Offer A: $100 [[Cost per Action|CPA]], converts at 0.5% → EPC = `0.005 × $100` = **$0.50**
> - Offer B: $20 CPA, converts at 5% → EPC = `0.05 × $20` = **$1.00**
>
> Offer B earns 2× more per click despite a 5× smaller payout. Without EPC you'd have picked the wrong one.

## Network EPC vs your EPC

- **Network/published EPC** — the average across *all* affiliates promoting the offer. A useful first filter, but it reflects other people's traffic quality, not yours.
- **Your own EPC** — what *your* traffic actually earns. This is the number that matters; track it per offer, per page, per traffic source.

> [!warning] Published EPC is a starting hint, not a promise
> A high network EPC can be driven by a few affiliates with perfectly-matched traffic. Your mismatched traffic may earn a fraction of it. Always validate with your own clicks before scaling.

## What EPC lets you do

- **Rank competing offers** in the same niche objectively.
- **Decide ad spend** — if your EPC is $0.80 and clicks cost $0.40 via paid traffic, you're profitable; if clicks cost $1.00, you're losing money.
- **Spot weak content** — a page with low EPC despite decent clicks signals poor offer-fit or weak placement.

## Worked example

Over a month, one review page sends 1,200 clicks to a [[Cost per Sale]] offer and earns $540 in confirmed commission.

```
EPC = $540 ÷ 1,200 = $0.45 per click  (or $45 per 100 clicks)
```

If a rival offer in the same niche shows your EPC of $0.70, switch the links — same traffic, 56% more revenue.

## Common gotchas

- **Confirmed vs pending** — compute EPC on *confirmed* earnings (after [[Reversal|reversals]]), not pending, or you'll overstate it.
- **Per-click vs per-100-clicks** — a 100× difference if you misread the basis.
- **Small samples lie** — EPC over 30 clicks is noise. Wait for a few hundred clicks before trusting it.
- **[[Cookie Duration]] skews it** — short cookie windows lower EPC by dropping delayed conversions.

## Related terms

- [[Cost per Action]] / [[Cost per Lead]] / [[Cost per Sale]] — the payout models EPC compares across.
- [[Average Order Value]] — a key input to EPC for %-of-sale offers.
- [[Cookie Duration]] — longer windows raise EPC by crediting more conversions.
- [[Reversal]] — reversals reduce confirmed earnings and thus true EPC.
- [[Attribution Model]] — affects which conversions count toward your EPC.
