# Cost per Sale

> [!summary]
> **Cost per Sale (CPS)** is an affiliate pricing model where the advertiser pays the affiliate only when a referred visitor makes an actual **purchase**. The payout is usually a **percentage of the sale value** (commission), though it can be a flat amount per order. It is the sub-type of [[Cost per Action]] where the triggering action is a completed sale.

## Plain-English definition

You send traffic to a merchant. Under CPS you get paid **only when that visitor buys** — and typically the payout scales with how much they spend. No sale, no payout, no matter how many people clicked or even signed up.

This is the most common model in retail affiliate marketing (Amazon Associates, most ShareASale/Impact retail programs) because the merchant pays purely out of money it has already collected.

This is the opposite end from [[Cost per Lead]]: CPS pays on the *purchase*, CPL pays on the earlier *expression of interest*.

## Where CPS sits

CPS is one of the three common [[Cost per Action]] flavours:

| Action that triggers payout | Model | Payout shape | Risk to affiliate |
|-----------------------------|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Becomes a lead (sign-up, form) | [[Cost per Lead]] (CPL) | Flat per lead | Medium |
| **Makes a purchase** | **CPS** | **% of sale, or flat per order** | **Highest** |
| Any defined event (umbrella) | [[Cost per Action]] (CPA) | Flat or % | Varies |

CPS carries the **most conversion risk** for the affiliate — the visitor must go all the way to checkout — so it usually offers the **highest payout per conversion** to compensate.

## How a CPS payout works

1. Affiliate places a tracked link.
2. Visitor clicks; a [[Cookie Duration|cookie]] records the affiliate's ID and timestamp.
3. Visitor buys within the cookie window.
4. The order enters a **validation / hold period** (covers returns, chargebacks, cancellations).
5. Once the return window closes and the order is confirmed, the **commission** is credited — e.g. *8% of order total*, or *$30 per completed order*.

> [!tip] AOV is your hidden multiplier
> Under percentage CPS, your earnings = `commission % × order value`. A 5% rate on a $2,000 order ($100) beats a 10% rate on a $40 order ($4). High **average order value (AOV)** niches (furniture, electronics, B2B software) can pay more at a *lower* percentage than cheap-product niches at a high percentage.

## Worked example

You run a product-review site. A retailer offers **8% CPS** with a 30-day cookie.

- 10,000 readers, 800 click your link (8%).
- 40 buy, with an average order of $150.
- Payout: `40 × $150 × 8% = $480`.

The 760 who clicked but didn't buy earn you nothing — that's the CPS trade-off.

## Common gotchas

> [!warning] Returns claw back your commission
> CPS payouts are **provisional until the return window closes**. If a customer refunds or cancels, the sale is reversed and the commission is removed (see [[Reversal]] / clawback). Your *confirmed* earnings are always lower than your *pending* earnings.

- **Category-specific rates** — many programs (e.g. Amazon) pay wildly different % by product category; a single headline rate is misleading.
- **Cookie window** — shorter windows (Amazon's 24h) drastically cut credited sales vs 30–90 day windows.
- **Attribution** — usually last-click; the last affiliate before purchase wins (see [[Attribution Model]]).
- **Excluded items** — gift cards, already-discounted items, or subscriptions may not earn commission.

## CPS vs flat-rate offers

- **Percentage CPS** — scales with basket size; great for high-AOV or upsell-heavy stores.
- **Flat CPS (cost per order)** — fixed amount per sale regardless of value; predictable, better when order values are small and uniform.

## When CPS is the right model to chase

- You produce **high-intent, bottom-of-funnel content** (reviews, "best X", comparisons) where readers are ready to buy.
- The product has a **clear online checkout** that can be tracked end-to-end.
- The niche has **decent AOV** or recurring upsell, so each sale is worth chasing.

If the purchase happens offline or weeks later (insurance, mortgages, enterprise SaaS), [[Cost per Lead]] is usually the better fit because the sale itself is hard to attribute.
