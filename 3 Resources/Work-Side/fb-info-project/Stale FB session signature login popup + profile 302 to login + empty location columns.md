# Stale FB session signature: login popup + profile 302 to /login + empty location columns

Symptom cluster that means the saved Facebook session in `session/fb_session.json` is **expired/insufficient**, even when `is_authenticated()` passes (i.e. `c_user` + `xs` cookies are present but stale):

1. Startup warning: `login popup detected — session may be expired`.
2. During profile visits, the fetcher logs `Fetched (302) GET .../<profile>` immediately followed by `Fetched (200) GET .../login/?next=...` — Facebook bounced the request to the login page.
3. The scraped page title comes back as the generic `"Facebook"` instead of the real post/profile title.
4. Output rows are produced (names + profile URLs collected from comments) but every `Nơi ở hoặc vị trí` / `Quê quán` / `Số điện thoại` column is empty, and the run logs `N row(s), 0 with a location`.

`c_user`/`xs` being present is necessary but **not sufficient** — they expire. Fix: re-export fresh facebook.com cookies (Cookie-Editor -> Export as JSON) into `session/fb_session.json`. Note not all empty-location rows mean a dead session — a logged-in run can still get blanks from privacy-restricted profiles; it's the 302->/login pattern that proves the session, not the page, is the problem.
