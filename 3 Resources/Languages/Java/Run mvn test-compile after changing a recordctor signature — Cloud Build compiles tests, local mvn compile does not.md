# Run mvn test-compile after changing a record/ctor signature — Cloud Build compiles tests, local mvn compile does not

luz-docs Cloud Build (build-maven-project step) compiles AND runs the test sources; a local 'mvn compile' only does main sources. So changing a shared record/constructor signature (e.g. adding a field to MaterializeState or MaterializeInput) compiles locally but FAILS the Cloud Build at test-compile because existing *Test.java files still call the old arity. Cost me a full ~8-min build cycle to discover.

Rule: after any signature change to a type used by tests, run 'mvn -q test-compile' (or 'mvn test') locally BEFORE shipping — not just 'mvn compile'. Fix the existing tests in the same change (add the new arg; a random/irrelevant field can take a dummy like 0 or null since the assertions check individual getters, not full-record equality).

Adjacent: when a record gains a field that is random/non-deterministic (_shard), check tests don't assert full-record equals()/toString() — those would break; per-getter assertions are safe.
