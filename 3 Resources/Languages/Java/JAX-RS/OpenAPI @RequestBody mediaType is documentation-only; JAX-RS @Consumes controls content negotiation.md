# OpenAPI @RequestBody mediaType is documentation-only; JAX-RS @Consumes controls content negotiation

The MicroProfile OpenAPI `@RequestBody(content = @Content(mediaType = ...))` annotation only shapes the generated OpenAPI/Swagger spec — it has **zero effect on runtime content negotiation**. What a JAX-RS endpoint actually accepts and returns is decided solely by `@Consumes`/`@Produces`.

Consequences worth remembering:
- A class-level `@Consumes(APPLICATION_JSON)` applies to **every** method in the resource unless a method overrides it with its own `@Consumes`. A request whose `Content-Type` is not in that list is rejected with **415 Unsupported Media Type** before the method body ever runs.
- So changing the `@RequestBody` `mediaType` to advertise a new type does nothing on its own — you must also add it to `@Consumes`.

Concrete example: in luz_jsonstore's `JsonStoreMongoDbResource`, every method's `@RequestBody` says `mediaType = APPLICATION_JSON`, but the real gatekeeper is the class-level `@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)` (no method-level overrides exist), so all endpoints are JSON-only.
