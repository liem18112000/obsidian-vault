# Moderation taxonomies split violence into subtypes

Serious moderation systems never treat "violence" as one label — they split it into subtypes because the right action differs per subtype. OpenAI moderation API distinguishes `violence` (glorification/support of violent acts, threats) from `violence/graphic` (explicit gore/injury detail); it also has harassment/threatening. Llama Guard 3 follows the MLCommons 13-hazard taxonomy where S1 = violent crimes (terrorism, murder, assault, kidnapping, violence toward animals). Perspective API exposes a THREAT attribute.

When building a detector, mirror this: report per-subtype scores (e.g. general violence vs graphic violence vs direct threat) so callers can apply different thresholds/policies per subtype.
