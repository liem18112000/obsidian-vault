# Regenerate-from-review-feedback pattern: reuse the branch/PR, don't open a new one

When adding a "regenerate from reviewer feedback" capability to an AI-driven code-authoring pipeline (an agent writes code, opens a PR, a human reviews and leaves comments, then you want the agent to address them), the right shape is: reuse the SAME branch/worktree and the SAME open PR — never create a fresh one.

Concretely: fetch every comment currently on the PR, feed them to the agent as explicit context ("here is real reviewer feedback, address each one with an actual code change"), let it edit the existing files in place on the existing branch, then commit + push to that SAME branch. Since the PR already tracks that branch, pushing new commits updates the existing PR automatically — no new PR needed, and the reviewer sees an updated diff on the same review thread they already commented on.

Why this matters: if you instead spawned a fresh worktree/branch/PR for the "regenerate" action, you'd fragment the review — the reviewer's original comments would live on an abandoned PR while the fix appears in an unrelated new one, breaking the natural feedback loop review tools are built around (comment → push → comment resolves).

Practical gating rules that fell out of this: only allow regenerate on an implementation that's already `done` (not `failed` — that's what a plain "Retry" is for) and that actually has a PR to pull comments from; and fail fast with a clear error if there are zero comments to consume, rather than silently running a pointless no-feedback re-generation.

Applied in vinnstack's BDD "Test implementation" stage (`lib/bdd/implementRunner.ts`'s `regenerateImplementation`, alongside the original `implementBddScenario`) — the two functions share a `commitPushAndFinish` tail (commit → push → detect-or-open PR → mark complete) extracted specifically so "open a NEW PR" logic (`openOrGetPr`) naturally becomes "reuse the existing one" when the branch/PR already exist, with zero special-casing needed.
