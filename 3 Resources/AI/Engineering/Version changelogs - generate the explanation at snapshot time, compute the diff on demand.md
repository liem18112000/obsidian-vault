# Version changelogs - generate the explanation at snapshot time, compute the diff on demand

Adding "compare versions + short explanation" to versioned artifacts (Vinnstack md_exports, 2026-07-23) splits cleanly by WHEN each piece is cheap:

- **Explanation → generate at snapshot time, asynchronously.** The moment a new version lands is the only moment both texts are naturally in hand and the trigger (submit/regenerate) is known. Fire-and-forget a cheap tool-less LLM call (effort `low` via the per-stage map) whose input is the LINE DIFF (capped ~12k chars), not both full documents — smaller, and forces the summary to be about the delta. Store on the version row (`explanation TEXT`); UI shows "being written… refresh shortly" until it arrives. Failures just leave NULL.
- **Diff → compute on demand, server-side.** Don't store diffs (derivable) and don't ship both documents to the client. A dependency-free LCS line diff (~40 lines, O(n·m) fine for few-hundred-line docs) with context collapsed to 2 lines around changes ('⋯ N unchanged lines ⋯') renders directly as colored <pre> lines (+ green, - red).
- **UI: collapsed-by-default strip** whose collapsed state still shows the latest explanation truncated inline ("Changes · v2 → v3 — <summary>…") — the information is glanceable without the expansion, satisfying "default minimized" without hiding the value.

Gotcha hit: adding a new LLM call site means extending the typed `UsageKind` union (usage telemetry) and the effort map — grep for the unions when introducing a new run kind.
