# Command-scanning git-commit hooks miss flag-separated forms and -F message files

A PreToolUse hook that blocks commits by regex-scanning the `git commit` command string has two structural gaps beyond whatever pattern it checks.

1. **Flag-separated invocations.** `\bgit\s+commit\b` only matches when `commit` immediately follows `git`, so `git -C <path> commit` or `git -c key=val commit` sail through. Match `\bgit\b[^|;&]*\bcommit\b` instead — the `[^|;&]*` allows intervening flags but stops at command separators, so `git log | grep x; svn commit` does not false-positive.

2. **Message files are invisible.** `git commit -F file` / `--file` puts the message on disk, not in the command string — no command-scanning hook can see it. Catching that requires a real git `commit-msg` hook in the repo, which inspects the final message regardless of how it was supplied.

Accept the small false-positive cost: a legit message that merely *mentions* the blocked phrase (e.g. docs about the policy) will be denied — usually the right trade for an enforcement hook.

Verified 2026-06-05 against `~/.claude/hooks/git/block-coauthor.ps1` with a 7-case harness piping JSON payloads into the script.
