# Custom Telegram-Claude bridge vs official Claude Code Remote Control

A homegrown Telegram→Claude bridge (a notify hook for Stop/Notification + a long-poll daemon that runs headless `claude --resume -p` and streams output back) can do several things the **official `claude remote-control`** cannot:

- **API-key auth works.** Official RC requires claude.ai OAuth on Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise; API keys are rejected.
- **Survives an org policy block.** Official RC can be disabled by a Team/Enterprise admin toggle; the bridge is independent.
- **Survives closing the terminal.** Official RC dies when the `claude` process exits; the bridge resumes sessions on demand, so there is nothing to keep alive.
- **No ~10-minute network-outage timeout** (official RC times out).
- **Coexists with ultraplan** (official RC disconnects when ultraplan starts — both want the claude.ai/code surface).
- **Many sessions/projects from one chat** (official RC = one remote session per interactive process outside server mode).
- **No version floor** (official RC needs Claude Code v2.1.51+).
- **Permission approvals as inline chat buttons** without the Claude mobile app — see [[Remote permission approval via a blocking PreToolUse hook]].

**Tradeoff / what it gives up:** the bridge runs *separate headless turns* of a session (`claude --resume -p`). It does NOT steer the live interactive terminal session you are watching. Tmux/PTY-injection bots (ccgram, JessyTsui Claude-Code-Remote) and official RC *do* drive the live session — but injection is Unix-oriented and brittle on Windows, so headless-resume is the better fit there.

Reference points: official docs `code.claude.com/docs/en/remote-control`; community bots `github.com/jsayubi/ccgram`, `github.com/JessyTsui/Claude-Code-Remote`.
