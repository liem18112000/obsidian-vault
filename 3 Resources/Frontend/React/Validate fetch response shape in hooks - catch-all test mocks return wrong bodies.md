# Validate fetch response shape in hooks - catch-all test mocks return wrong bodies

A hook that trusts its endpoint's shape (`if (j.ok) setState(j.items)`) can crash the ENTIRE host component tree on an **ok-but-wrong-shape** response: state becomes `undefined` and the next render throws at `state.filter(...)` / `state.length` / `state.slice(...)`. testing-library then shows an empty `<body>` with "Unhandled Errors" — a symptom far from the cause.

Where the bad body comes from: tests that stub fetch with a **catch-all URL matcher**. Embed a new child component with its own fetch into an existing tested component and the old mock happily answers the NEW endpoint with the OLD body (`{ok:true, interrogation}` instead of `{ok:true, comments}`), or a bare `{ok:true}` with the array field simply omitted. Partial-but-ok responses happen in prod too.

Guard at the assignment, two interchangeable forms:
- `if (j.ok && Array.isArray(j.comments)) setComments(j.comments)`
- `setVersions(j.exports ?? [])` for `useState<T[]>([])`

One cheap conjunct turns a whole-tree crash into a benign no-op, in prod and in tests alike. A cosmetic list should degrade to empty, never take the surface down.

Real cases (vinnstack, 2026-07): `usePrdComments`; and `MdExportControl` + `VersionChanges`, which both read `/api/export/md` this way and both crashed under a `{ok:true}` mock.
