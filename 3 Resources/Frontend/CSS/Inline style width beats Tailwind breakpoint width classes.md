# Inline style width beats Tailwind breakpoint width classes

An inline `style={{width: ...}}` prop on a React element always overrides a Tailwind breakpoint class like `lg:w-56` targeting the same `width` property, because inline styles carry higher CSS specificity than any class selector — Tailwind cannot win this fight no matter which breakpoint variant is used.

This bites components that size themselves via JS state rather than pure CSS: e.g. a collapsible side panel that picks its pixel width from `open` state (`style={{width: open ? 224 : 40}}`). Adding `lg:w-56`/`lg:w-10` classes to try to make it responsive silently does nothing below or above the breakpoint — the inline style always wins, so the panel stays a fixed pixel width at every viewport size. There is no console warning or type error; the layout just looks wrong at narrow widths, which makes this easy to miss during a quick review of the JSX.

The fix is to drop the inline style entirely and encode every state as a Tailwind class picked by a ternary inside a template literal:

```jsx
className={`relative w-full overflow-hidden lg:shrink-0 ${open ? "lg:w-56" : "lg:w-10"}`}
```

`w-full` supplies the width below the breakpoint (lets it fill its container when the layout is stacked), and the `lg:` variants restore the old fixed pixel width only at that breakpoint and up. This composes cleanly when the original pixel values land exactly on Tailwind's 4px spacing scale (56*4=224px, 10*4=40px, 72*4=288px) — otherwise fall back to arbitrary-value classes like `lg:w-[224px]`.

Found and fixed in the vinnstack project (AiFeedback.tsx, PrdComments.tsx comment rail) while making a desktop-only layout degrade to tablet widths — verified with Playwright screenshots at 768/900/1280px that the fixed-width panels then correctly went full-width below `lg` and back to their pixel width above it.
