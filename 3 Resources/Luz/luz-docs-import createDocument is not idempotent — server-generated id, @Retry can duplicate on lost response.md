# luz-docs-import createDocument is not idempotent — server-generated id, @Retry can duplicate on lost response

luz-docs-import `LuzDocsViewControllerService.createDocument` sends `POST /documents` with only `files` + `folderIds` + `metadata` (origin/dates/title/health-data via `HealthDocImporter.applyMetadata`). **No client-supplied id / idempotency key** — the document id is minted server-side (downstream in luz-docs-view-controller/luz-docs) per POST. So creation is NOT idempotent.

**Two duplication vectors:**
1. **`@Retry(delay=3000)` on createDocument** — if the POST succeeds at luz-docs but the RESPONSE is lost (timeout/5xx on return), the retry creates a SECOND document for the same file. Happens within a single import; no job-doc dedup can prevent it.
2. **Re-import** — dedup rests ENTIRELY on the app-level `IdempotentImportService` (reads prior jobs` `successfulFiles`); if that record is lost, re-import duplicates.

**Making it idempotent (Tier 3) is a cross-service contract change, not luz-docs-import-only:** client computes a deterministic key (e.g. `hash(tenantId+importZipName+relativePath[+contentHash])`) and sends it; the downstream `POST /documents` endpoint must ACCEPT it and treat it as an UPSERT key (create-if-absent). Only this closes BOTH vectors.
