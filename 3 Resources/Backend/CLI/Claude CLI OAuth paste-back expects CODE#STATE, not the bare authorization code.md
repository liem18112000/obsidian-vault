# Claude CLI OAuth paste-back expects CODE#STATE, not the bare authorization code

`claude setup-token` (and the manual paste-back path of `claude login`) print an auth URL, and after you authorize the browser lands on `https://platform.claude.com/oauth/code/callback?code=<CODE>&state=<STATE>`. The value the CLI's "Paste code here" prompt wants is NOT the bare `code` — it is `CODE#STATE`: the authorization code and the state parameter joined with a literal `#`. Pasting only the code, or the whole URL, leaves the exchange unable to complete: setup-token accepts the input (echoes it masked) but never prints the `sk-ant-oat…` token, so an automating harness just hangs to its timeout with no token.

State is joined because the flow is PKCE + CSRF: the CLI needs the state it generated to validate the callback and complete the token exchange.

When automating this (e.g. a web relay that feeds the paste value to setup-token over a PTY), normalize whatever the operator pastes — full callback URL, bare code, or already-formatted CODE#STATE — into CODE#STATE before sending: if it already contains '#' pass through; else regex out code= and state= from the URL/query and join them. Pair with sending Enter as \r (see linked note) — both are required for the paste-back to actually complete.
