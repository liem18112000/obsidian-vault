# Kafka sink: append-only log, idempotency via dedupe_key message key

When Kafka is the CDP ingestion sink (connector publishes events; Leo CDP consumes the topic), a few patterns make the sink class clean and correct:

**A topic is an append-only log — there is no 'replace a partition'.** So a sink whose Protocol has both `write_partition` (batch/Pull) and `append_partition` (streaming/Push) implements BOTH as the same publish — the batch-vs-stream distinction (replace vs append) that matters for files/HTTP is meaningless for a log.

**Idempotency is delegated downstream via the message KEY.** Use each event's `dedupe_key` (content hash) as the Kafka message key. A log-compacted topic (or an upserting consumer) then collapses re-published duplicates — AppsFlyer push retries, or a re-run pull day — without the producer tracking state. This is how you keep at-least-once producing safe.

**Make the client optional + the sink testable:** import the Kafka client lazily inside `__init__` (so importing the module needs no `confluent-kafka` install) and accept an injectable `producer` (so unit tests pass a fake with `produce()`/`flush()` and need no broker). Ship the client as an optional extra (`pip install '.[kafka]'`).

**Delivery errors:** confluent_kafka's `produce()` is async; pass an `on_delivery(err, msg)` callback that records errors, then `flush()` (blocks until delivered/failed), then raise if any failed — turning fire-and-forget into a synchronous raise-on-failure like an HTTP sink.

For the Leo CDP AppsFlyer connector this let BOTH the push receiver and the pull pipeline/DAG share one KafkaSink. See [[A webhook receiver deploys as an always-on service, not a scheduled job]] and [[AppsFlyer Push layer appends per-event while Pull replaces the day]].
