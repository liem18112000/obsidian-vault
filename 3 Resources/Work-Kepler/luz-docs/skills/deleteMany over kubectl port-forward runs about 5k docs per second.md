# deleteMany over kubectl port-forward runs about 5k docs per second

Calibration point for estimating tenant-clean durations on the Luz dev MongoDB clusters: `deleteMany({})` of 128,202 eArchive documents (rich ~production-shaped docs with `documentTextContent` lorem paragraphs) through a `kubectl port-forward` to the replica primary took 24.3 s — roughly 5,000 docs/s. The 88-folder collection cleared in 0.2 s.

So a full canary-sized wipe is ~25 s end to end; budget minutes only for multi-million-doc tenants. Measured 2026-06-11 on tenant b260a45a (luz-mongodb03-cluster-rs-0) via the earchive-data-clean skill.
