# luz-docs Search Logic

> **Reading order** below. Each section is its own note in the sibling `search-logic/` folder, so you can jump around without scrolling a 600-line file. Every jargon term links to a plain-English definition in [[Glossary|Glossary]].

## Map of Contents

1. [[01 Overview|01 — Overview]]
   *What luz-docs search is and where the translation layer lives.*

2. [[02 Endpoints|02 — Endpoints]]
   *`/search` vs `/count`, their query params, and when to use which.*

3. [[03 Request Body|03 — Request Body]]
   *The JSON skeleton: `from`, `size`, `query`, `facets`, `sort`, `includes`, `excludes`.*

4. [[04 Query Operators|04 — Query Operators]]
   *`term`, `terms`, `exists`, `not`, `regexp`, `range`, `and`, `or` — each with client syntax, MongoDB output, and an example.*

5. [[05 Operator Nesting|05 — Operator Nesting]]
   *How to build complex queries by combining operators. The fulltext-search pattern.*

6. [[06 Server Filters|06 — Automatic Server Filters]]
   *Deletion status, being-created guard, security class, credential mapping. Why your result count may be smaller than expected.*

7. [[07 Aggregation Pipeline|07 — Aggregation Pipeline Order]]
   *The 9-stage `/search` pipeline and the 12-stage `/count` pipeline, with rationale for the order.*

8. [[08 Facets|08 — Facet Aggregations]]
   *Group-by counts, multi-field grouping, multi-facet operators, `missing` facet.*

9. [[09 Examples|09 — Common Use-Case Examples]]
   *Copy-pasteable recipes for the queries you'll write most often.*

## At-a-glance

- **What it is:** a JSON query [[3 Resources/Work-Kepler/luz-docs/search/search-logic/Glossary#DSL (Domain-Specific Language)|DSL]] (Elasticsearch-shaped) that compiles to [[3 Resources/Work-Kepler/luz-docs/search/search-logic/Glossary#MongoDB|MongoDB]] [[3 Resources/Work-Kepler/luz-docs/search/search-logic/Glossary#Aggregation Pipeline|aggregation pipelines]].
- **Where the magic happens:** `JsonStoreSearchQueryUtil` (per-operator translation) and `JsonStoreQuerySearchUtil` (pipeline assembly).
- **REST base:** `POST /luz_docs/api/{tenant_id}/documents`
- **Two endpoints:** `/search` (with optional facets) and `/count` (count only, no facets).
- **Safety net:** four automatic filters (deletion, being-created, security class, credentials) are always appended to your query. Two are bypassable; two aren't.
