title: HyperLogLog estimates distinct count in constant memory and is mergeable

# HyperLogLog estimates distinct count in constant memory and is mergeable

**HyperLogLog (HLL)** estimates the number of *distinct* elements in **fixed, tiny memory** with a small bounded error.

Mechanism:
1. Hash each element to a uniform bit string.
2. First `p` bits pick a **register** (bucket); there are `m = 2^p` registers.
3. In the remaining bits, count leading zeros + 1 = rho. Keep the **max rho** per register.
4. A harmonic-mean-based estimator over all registers gives the cardinality. Intuition: a long run of leading zeros is rare, so a high max rho implies many distinct elements.

**Sizing:** `m = 2^14` registers ~ **12 KB** gives ~**0.8%** standard error. Memory is **constant** regardless of how many documents.

**Why it fits the union model:** HLLs are **mergeable** — union of two HLLs = register-wise **max**. So precompute one HLL per security code, merge the user's codes (+ public), then estimate. Same union shape as [[Visible-document count as cardinality of a bitmap union]] but with sketches.

**Limits:** approximate only (~1-2% error, both directions); **count-only** — cannot enumerate documents, cannot reliably subtract sets. For a security-facing number, exact ([[Roaring bitmaps give exact set cardinality via chunked containers]]) is usually safer; HLL is for extreme-scale, approximate-OK display counts.
