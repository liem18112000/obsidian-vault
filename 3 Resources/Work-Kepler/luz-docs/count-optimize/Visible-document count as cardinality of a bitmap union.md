title: Visible-document count as cardinality of a bitmap union

# Visible-document count as cardinality of a bitmap union

A user's visible-document count = **cardinality of a union of precomputed bitmaps**, instead of scanning matching index entries.

Model each security code's document set as a bitmap (bit i = doc i carries that code); the public set is another bitmap:

```
visible = | publicSet OR codeSet[c1] OR codeSet[c2] OR ... |   (for each c in user.codes)
```

Union = bitwise **OR**; count = **popcount**.

**Why it matters — it removes the doc×code amplification.** The naive count (public OR docs intersecting any of the user's codes) makes the index walk pay for every `(doc × matching-code)` entry and then dedup by RecordId, so work scales with amplification, not with the answer — this is the heavy-user p99 tail. After OR, a doc carrying 5 of the user's codes is one bit: dedup is free and work scales with the **number of codes**, not doc×code entries.

**Representations:** [[Roaring bitmaps give exact set cardinality via chunked containers]] (exact — required for a security-facing number) and [[HyperLogLog estimates distinct count in constant memory and is mergeable]] (approximate, ~12 KB fixed, ~1–2% error). See [[Count-scaling path fan-out first, Roaring next, HyperLogLog for approximate]].

**Cost / why it is deferred (DESIGN §8 "decide separately"):** the per-code bitmaps plus a stable doc-id↔int ordinal dictionary must be **maintained on the write path** (create / delete / security-class change) and kept hot. That is a bigger change than `_shard` fan-out.

**vs `_shard` fan-out:** fan-out spreads the *same* amplified work across K cores (ceiling = cores, needs CPU + hot index); bitmaps **eliminate** the work algorithmically — heavy count goes from seconds to a sub-ms popcount regardless of code/doc counts. Complementary: bitmaps are the next lever once fan-out's ceiling is not enough.
