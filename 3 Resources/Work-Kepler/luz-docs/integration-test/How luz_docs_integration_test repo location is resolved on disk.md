# How luz_docs_integration_test repo location is resolved on disk

The `~/.claude/skills/luz-docs-integration-test/run_it.sh` skill's `locate_repo()` function resolves the `luz_docs_integration_test` repo on disk by checking a fixed candidate-path list, in order:

```
$HOME/Kepler/luz_docs_integration_test
$HOME/luz_docs_integration_test
$HOME/AI/luz_docs_integration_test
$HOME/Kepler/leo-cdp-framework/luz_docs_integration_test
```

then falls back to a bounded scan (`find "$HOME" -maxdepth 4 -type d -name luz_docs_integration_test`), accepting a match only if it also contains `requirements.txt` and a `features/` directory. If nothing matches, it stops and prints a clone notice (`git clone https://bitbucket.org/axonivy-prod/luz_docs_integration_test.git ~/Kepler/luz_docs_integration_test`) rather than cloning automatically.

On dvtliem's machine this resolves to `C:\Users\dvtliem\Kepler\luz_docs_integration_test` (git remote `bitbucket.org/axonivy-prod/luz_docs_integration_test`). Any new skill/tool that needs to locate this repo should reuse this same candidate-list-then-bounded-scan pattern rather than hardcoding one path, so it keeps working across machines.
