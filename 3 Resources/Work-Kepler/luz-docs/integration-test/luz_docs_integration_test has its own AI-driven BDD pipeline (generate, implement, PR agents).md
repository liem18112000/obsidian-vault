# luz_docs_integration_test has its own AI-driven BDD pipeline (generate, implement, PR agents)

luz_docs_integration_test (the behave/Cucumber IT suite for luz-docs) already contains a full multi-agent AI pipeline under `helpers/ai/`, on branch `ai-feature-generation` (not yet merged to master as of 2026-07-11) — built on Gemini/Vertex AI (ReAct agents), separate from any vinnstack-side automation.

Pipeline stages, chained by `OrchestratorAgent`:
- `TestGeneratorAgent` — Jira ticket key -> Gherkin scenarios -> imports them into an Xray Test Set.
- `StepImplementerAgent` — Xray Test Set key -> writes Python behave step definitions -> runs `behave` -> self-corrects/retries until 100% pass.
- `PRCreator` — bundles the generated files into a single BitBucket PR.

CLI entry point: `python -m helpers.ai.service {generate|implement|full} <KEY>` (`generate` takes a Jira issue key, `implement` takes an Xray Test Set key, `full` runs both). Runnable locally or as a GKE Job (`cloudbuild-ai.yaml` + `gke/k8s-ai.yaml`).

Relevant when designing any new "generate BDD tests" or "implement BDD steps" automation for this org — this pipeline is the working reference implementation to mirror conventions from, even if the new automation (e.g. a Claude-based vinnstack skill) uses a different LLM/orchestration layer.
