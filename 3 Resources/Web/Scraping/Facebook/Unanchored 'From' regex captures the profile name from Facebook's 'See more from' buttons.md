# Unanchored 'From' regex captures the profile name from Facebook's 'See more from' buttons

When parsing a Facebook profile's visible body text for the hometown intro field, an **unanchored, case-insensitive `From` regex is a trap**: Facebook's feed is full of **"See more from `<Name>`"** buttons, so `(?:From)\s+(.{2,60})` matches that "from `<Name>`" and captures the profile's **own name** as the hometown. Every profile lacking a public hometown then gets its own name in the "Quê quán" column.

**Fix:** anchor the intro label to the start of its line — `(?m)^\s*(?:Đến từ|From)\s+(.{2,60})$` — because the real intro ("From `<city>`" / "Đến từ `<city>`") sits at the start of its own line, while "See more from X" has "from" mid-line.

General lesson: regexes over scraped UI text must anchor on label position, not just the label word — common English words ("From", "Lives", "At") recur in chrome/buttons. The Vietnamese label "Đến từ" was safe (the VN "see more from" is "Xem thêm **từ**", a different token), which is why only English profiles showed the bug.
