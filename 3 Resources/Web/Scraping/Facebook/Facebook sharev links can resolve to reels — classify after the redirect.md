# Facebook /share/v/ links can resolve to reels — classify after the redirect

A Facebook `/share/v/<code>/` link (the `v` nominally meaning "video") does NOT reliably point to a video — it can 302-redirect to a **reel** (e.g. `/share/v/1KVtDop6j6/` → `/reel/988246677276789`). The same unreliability applies to the `/share/<letter>/` family generally: the letter (v/r/p) is only a weak hint, not the true content type.

**Consequence for scraping:** classifying the scrape mode from the raw share URL's path text misclassifies these — a reel-behind-`/share/v/` gets treated as a video, so the reel comment side-panel is never opened and zero comments are collected.

**Fix / rule:** resolve the 302 redirect to the canonical URL FIRST (e.g. via curl_cffi with session cookies + browser TLS impersonation), then classify the resolved URL. In fb-info-project this meant calling `resolve_redirect()` in `service.batch()` for any `/share/` or `fb.watch/` link, not only for bare-numeric-id links. Reels also need URL normalization afterward to strip the `?rdid=&share_url=` query the redirect appends.
