# Agent Loop 3 - Test-Plan Definition

## Overview

The Test-Plan Definition (TPD) agent turns an **approved insight pack** (from the knowledge-gathering agent) into an **executable BDD test suite**. It does this with a single agentic loop over one shared `context_id`:

> **DEFINE** (interrogate the human, **4 rounds**) → **APPROVE** (lock the plan) → **IMPLEMENT** (interrogate the *artifacts*, then generate data + scenarios + steps).

Both phases are now **interrogative** — the agent asks the human the judgement calls rather than guessing them — and the generated suite is scored against a **coverage matrix**. Everything is persisted to a shared **GCS memory bank**, and the whole thing is served as one Cloud Run service that speaks both **A2A** (agent-to-agent JSON-RPC) and **MCP** (the tools Claude calls).

### Control plane

Three tiers, one request path. The client never touches business logic directly — it drives the loop through a fixed tool surface.

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Tier | What it is | Key entry points |
| **MCP bridge** | The 6 tools Claude calls | `define_plan`, `approve_plan`, `implement_plan`, `get_plan`, `get_scenarios`, `get_coverage` |
| **A2A router** | A prefix-verb router + orchestrators | `define` / `approve` / `implement` / `get-test-plan` / `get-scenarios` / `get-coverage`; nests a `define` agent and an `implement` **orchestrator** |
| **GCS memory bank** | Shared, durable state | `memory/test-plan/<ctx>/` |

- The bridge forwards every tool call to the agent as an A2A `message/send` **(JSON-RPC 2.0)**; the same `context_id` threads all the way from gather → refine → define → implement, so no state is passed by hand.

- Long LLM calls run **off the event loop** (`asyncio.to_thread`) so a multi-second Vertex call never starves Cloud Run's `/livez` probe and gets the instance killed.

- **The client owns every confirm gate.** Before starting define, before approve, and before each implement round, Claude asks the human a Yes/No — the agent never auto-advances.

- **The router is state-aware.** A live define or implement interrogation routes the next answer-turn back to the right sub-agent automatically (it reads `state.json` / `implement-state.json`), so multi-turn interrogation "just works" over the flat tool surface.

## The agentic loop

### Phase A — DEFINE (interrogate the plan)

A multi-turn interrogation, one round per human turn, over exactly **four** rounds, in order:

1.  **methodology** — API / E2E / UI (default: API)

2.  **scope** — feature in/out of scope + one question per integration touched

3.  **metrics** — what "passed" means + the coverage bar

4.  **test-design** — *which test-design method(s) to use* — the agent **suggests** the method from the feature's shape (a lifecycle/state machine → state-transition; an eligibility/pricing matrix → decision table; many parameters → pairwise; several dependencies → error-path; risk markers → risk-based depth; always EP+BVA as the base) and from the earlier three rounds, then asks the human to accept / change / **add**.

The engine is a simple ask/pause cycle: `generate_round` produces the round's questions (via the LLM when Vertex is configured, else a heuristic strategy), the agent **pauses** (`requires_input`), the human answers with `define_plan(answer=…)`, and the answer is distilled into a `PlanDecision` (a human answer is a high-confidence *decision*; an agent self-answer is a low-confidence *assumption*).

> **Design note — the stop condition is structural, not confidence-gated.** The loop advances **one round per human turn** and stops when the four rounds are exhausted. There is no "am I confident enough?" gate deciding whether to ask more. Confidence is computed only at the end and merely sets the plan's status.

**Output:** a `TestPlan` (`methodology`, `scope`, `out_of_scope`, `metrics`, `test_design`) plus a human-readable `plan-brief.md`. Status is `confirmed` if there are no open gaps, otherwise `draft`.

#### Gate — APPROVE (lock)

`approve_plan` is the reconfirm gate. There is **no separate lock object** — it simply flips `TestPlan.status` to `confirmed`. **The status field** ***is*** **the lock.** A `draft` plan (with unresolved open gaps) is blocked from implementation until approve force-confirms it.

### Phase B — IMPLEMENT (interrogate the artifacts, then generate)

Interactive implement is now an **orchestrator** (`ImplementOrchestrator`) that nests two sub-agents and runs them in sequence over the turns:

```
implement  ─▶  interrogate  (case-design → data-design → step-oracle)  ─▶  generate
                └ an ImplementSession mirroring the define PlanSession        └ data → scenarios → steps → .feature
```

**Interrogate** asks the QA/QC judgement calls the one-shot path used to guess:

- **case-design** — *which test KINDS to cover.* The four defaults (happy / negative / boundary / error) are only a seed; the round **asks the human to add more** (security, performance, concurrency, compliance, accessibility, i18n, migration…). The answer updates the plan's **open** `test_kinds` taxonomy.

- **data-design** — valid/invalid partitions + boundary values; which dependencies are stubbed vs hit for real; fixtures.

- **step-oracle** — the oracle each case asserts (end-state / side-effect vs `assert 200`)

  - teardown + negative assertions.

Once the design is confirmed, the orchestrator chains into **generate** (the same one-shot generator, now driven by the elicited kinds):

**test data → scenarios → steps → Gherkin** `.feature`

#### **Two overlays wrap generation:**

- **Assured loop (opt-in,** `assured=True` **/** `TPD_ASSURED`**).** Replaces the single blind scenario call with a bounded *generate → LLM-as-judge → gate → reflect → regenerate* loop; the score rides on the reply and is checkpointed (`assured.json`) so a Cloud-Run kill resumes, not restarts. Default OFF keeps the single call.

- **Coverage matrix (always).** After scenarios are written, a **codegraph-driven coverage matrix** is built: requirement units (notes + insights) + code units (codegraph **endpoints + hubs**) × the open kinds, with a **traceability + gap report** and a coverage %. Read it with `get_coverage`.

**Output:** `get_scenarios` returns `scenarios.md` (BDD/Gherkin) which the client renders into the final HTML artifact; `get_coverage` returns the traceability/gap report.

## State machine

```
draft  ──approve_plan──▶  confirmed  ──implement (interrogate → generate)──▶  implemented
```

Three coupled states drive the lifecycle: `TestPlan.status` **{draft \| confirmed}**, the resumable **define session** `state.json` **{done}**, and the resumable **implement session** `implement-state.json` **{done}**. There is no separate `implemented` flag — implementation is evidenced by the written scenario artifacts + coverage matrix plus the run-log.

## What lands in GCS

All TPD artifacts live in a **separate namespace** from the knowledge-gathering agent's (`memory/refine/<ctx>/`), keyed by the same `context_id`:

```
memory/test-plan/<ctx>/
  questions.json  answers.json  decisions.json          # define interrogation trail
  plan.json  plan.md  plan-brief.md                     # the plan (+ test_design) + human brief
  implement-state.json  implement-decisions.json  implement-brief.md   # implement interrogation
  test-data.json  scenarios.json  scenarios.md  steps.json
  features/<name>.feature                               # BDD export
  assured.json                                          # P4 assured-loop checkpoint (when enabled)
  coverage.json  coverage-matrix.md                     # Q5 coverage matrix + gap report
  state.json                                            # resumable define session
memory/runs/<ts>_plan-<run_id>.md                       # run-log
memory/graphify/<repo>/latest/…                         # codegraph the matrix reads (shared registry)
```

The shared knowledge graph also gains `TEST_PLAN` + `TEST_SCENARIO` nodes with provenance edges back to the source notes/insights. Read-back always goes through the **JSON sidecars** (schema-drift tolerant); the `.md` files are presentational / write-only.
