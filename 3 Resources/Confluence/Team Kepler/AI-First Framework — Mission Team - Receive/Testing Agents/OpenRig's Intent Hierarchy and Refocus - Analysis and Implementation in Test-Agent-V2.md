# OpenRig's Intent Hierarchy and Refocus: Analysis and Implementation in Test-Agent-V2

*Confluence source · Team Kepler › AI-First Framework — Mission Team: Receive › Testing Agents › Agent Loop 4: Test-Plan Execution · [view original](https://axonivy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TK/pages/49785077788/OpenRig+s+Intent+Hierarchy+and+Refocus+Analysis+and+Implementation+in+Test-Agent-V2) · updated 2026-09-27*

## Overview

The intent hierarchy is real and maps onto us cleanly. Two corrections to the framing, both load-bearing:

1.  **Refocus is a delivery channel, not a validator.**

    - It re-injects the intent chain at turn boundaries and asks three questions.

    - Nothing computes "is this slice still needed."

2.  **A one-line intent is explicitly NOT the mechanism.**

    - openrig's fidelity law calls a one-line intent *"a ~20:1 lossy compression"* and requires the full design contract deposited INLINE in the leaf.

    - An intent-sentence-per-altitude would be the anti-pattern.

The deepest hit is not the intent hierarchy at all — it is `lore-routing.md`, whose founding rule is the exact thing we violated and then spent six mitigations undoing:

> The value is the combination of the content and where it was learned; **copying the bytes into a shared library destroys that distinction.**

Applying that lens to our code turned up a **live defect** (§6.4): the semantic arm of `recall_lessons` can never return an auto-captured lesson.

And the inversion worth the whole document: **openrig's refocus asks the agent to self-assess ("discomfort is the signal"). We own a calibrated judge. Ours can be measured.**

## What openrig is

> *"A harness wraps a model. A rig wraps your harnesses."*

A multi-agent harness for teams of coding agents (Claude Code + Codex):

- tmux-backed **seats** (a stable role and address, e.g. `dev-owner@first-project`),

- grouped into **pods**, defined by `RigSpec`/`AgentSpec` YAML,

- on a Hono/SQLite daemon with CLI, TUI and MCP surfaces.

- `CULTURE.md` sets coordination norms.

That is the runtime. Everything interesting for us is the **control plane** above it.

## The intent hierarchy — two trees

The prompt's Project → Mission → Slice is correct, but it is **one of two trees**, and the split is the point:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
| tree | path | answers | ships? |
| **Topology** | instance → rig → pod → seat | *how work is done here* | **yes** — general defaults ship in source |
| **Project** | project → mission → slice | *what is being built* | **no** — *"shipping a default would install someone else's project as your context"* |

**The chain-file convention (CE-v2): one filename, identical at every altitude.** A reader orients by walking from where they stand *toward the root*, reading the same-named file at each level. No pointers to follow, no per-level names, no branching. Chain files sit on **nodes** (rig, pod, seat; mission, slice) — never on shelves (`rigs/`, `missions/` are containment, not nodes, and carry no chain file).

Names: topology carries `LEARNED.md` (what a **position** has learned) and `CULTURE.md`. Project carries `SPEC.md`, `PROOF.md`, `PROGRESS.md`.

The composition rule:

> `SPEC.md` — **intent in frontmatter composes up the chain; specification is a leaf property.**

Intent is not restated per level — it *accumulates* as you walk to the root, and only the leaf carries the concrete spec. Confirmed on both ends: `project.yaml` selects `install.intent: SPEC.md`, and *"Mission and slice* `SPEC.md` *frontmatter supplies intent, advisory sibling build-order* `depends_on`*, lifecycle status, and queue linkage hints."*

The precedence order is made concrete by the operating-posture resolver — the cleanest statement of the altitude stack in the repo:

> qitem → workstream → mission → project → rig → global host

with qualifiers `qitem ID`, `project/mission/slice-id`, `project/mission`, `project ID`, `canonical rig ID`, `null`. That is the intent hierarchy as an actual lookup chain.

And the rule that stops the hierarchy from becoming a liability — **the fidelity law**:

> A slice folder is ready when **SPEC.md alone, plus only what SPEC.md explicitly routes to, reproduces the design intent in a reader who has none of your context.**
>
> **A one-line intent is a ~20:1 lossy compression; building from it alone matches the design only by coincidence.** Design that happened in conversation is deposited at mint time or it dies with the author's context window.

## Refocus — what it actually is

The prompt's description — *"makes the lower intent check if it's still needed to achieve the higher intent"* — is the **spirit**. The mechanism is different, and the difference decides what is worth building.

**Refocus is a delivery channel.** `openrig-core` ships `hooks/scripts/refocus.cjs`:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
| event | Claude Code | Codex | why |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | ✓ | ✓ | deliver at a model-visible boundary |
| `Stop` | ✓ | — | catch a long turn crossing the growth threshold |
| `PostCompact` | ✓ | ✓ | retain compaction due-state; deliver next prompt |

Claude's extra firing signal is **transcript growth** — *not* turns (*"one turn can burn 200k tokens across fifty tool calls"*) and *not* wall-clock (*"the failure is sustained work, not elapsed time"*). Default ≈2.6 MB of JSONL growth (≈300k tokens), `OPENRIG_REFOCUS_BYTES` tunes it. Fresh `SessionStart` is always a no-op — onboarding owns fresh orientation.

The premise, stated flatly, is the reason the thing exists at all:

> **Editing a file is not delivery.** A running seat read its configuration at session start, and nothing in its context re-reads disk on its own.

Delivered content: a path-only leaf→root trace of both chain trees (`scripts/trace-to-root.py --trees both --depth light`), plus three questions:

> 1.  What is the person actually trying to get? **Not your current task — the outcome.**
>
> 2.  Does what you are doing RIGHT NOW move that? If you cannot say what a user gets, stop and say so.
>
> 3.  What have you concluded **without opening the file or running the thing**?
>
> *Discomfort on any of these is the signal: **drift feels like work**.*

Two constraints worth copying verbatim:

- *"Your reads ARE the walk: a trace assembled from memory is a recitation that reproduces the drift it was meant to catch. **Run it; do not recall it.**"*

- *"A refocus corrects drift; it is **not a wake** (which restores liveness and must not reframe work) and **not a checkpoint** (a deliberate phase-boundary pause). Sending the heavy intervention when the light one was due is the most common self-inflicted stall."*

**So there is no automated "is this still needed" computation.** It is a scheduled re-injection plus three self-asked questions. Cheap and honest — and precisely the seam where we can do better, because we own a judge (§8).

![[image-20260925-024731.png]]

## Where openrig actually enforces anti-scope-creep

Five mechanisms, none of them Refocus:

1.  **Drift as a first-class review finding** (`wave-sdlc.md`). Reviewers review for drift, not only defects: *"is this still the doghouse the owner asked for, or did locally-defensible steps accrete toward a moon base? **Plot-loss is a first-class finding with the same standing as a logic defect.**"*

2.  **Cause disposition — one word per miss.** CONTEXT-GAP (*the spec or its routes lacked what the moment needed — a planning finding; the fix lands in the spec*) vs JUDGMENT-GAP (*the context was there and the call was wrong — a builder finding; the fix is a check*). *"The rate this produces is the calibration the dispatch shape tunes on."*

3.  **The A4 rule**, the sharpest sentence in the repo:

    **Building the missing pieces inside the slice IS the scope creep.** Discovering them and routing them is the slice working correctly — and a slice that reveals a real product gap has produced something more valuable than the feature it set out to deliver.

    The honest response to a broken assumption is to revise the ambition DOWN, mark the slice PARTIAL, and name each missing capability **at source, with the file and line that proves it is absent**.

4.  **Rigor priced per piece** — the planning dial P0–P4 (P0 pointers · P1 authored spec, the default · P2 + research *before* the spec freezes · P3 + adversarial pass · P4 + blind from-scratch design diffed against priors) and the wave as care dial. The discriminator is explicit and anti-intuitive: *"would a wrong plan be expensive, hard to undo, and invisible from inside"* — **never "is this piece central."**

5.  **The context gate.** *"Only agents with the product's world context installed may author research prompts, run adversarial passes, or weigh in on architecture questions… research shaped by someone who does not know what the product is for returns answers to the wrong question, fluently."*

Plus the dispatch discipline that keeps intent alive through fan-out — **the brief is the unit**, and *"THE BRIEF IS A MAP, NOT THE TERRITORY… the builder's first act is self-onboarding from the routed reading list, then checking the map against the ground it actually stands on."*

![[image-20260925-024859.png]]

## The two rules behind all of it

Both are about **compression loss**, which is the real subject of this comparison:

> The build is a **lossy compression pipeline**: product intent → planner spec → builder code, and each stage is a narrower reader than the one above. **Nothing leaks downward by proximity** — a dimension the owner's seat holds and does not WRITE AND ROUTE is deleted from the product, and **the deletion is silent: the downstream agent invents a plausible replacement rather than raising a hand.**

> **The spec is the router.** The downstream reader's world is SPEC.md; their curiosity does not extend past it, and **a file's existence is not a route**. Nothing load-bearing may depend on a reader's initiative.

Our pipeline is the same shape: ticket → pack → brief → plan → scenario → step → run. Six compressions, each with a narrower reader. Every one of our documented seam bugs is an instance of "the deletion is silent."

![[image-20260925-025431.png]]

## Our system, mapped honestly

test-agent-v2 today: four A2A agents behind one MCP gateway — KGA (`gather`/`refine`), TPD (`define`/`implement`), EXEC (`test_executor`), TEV (`test_evaluation`) — a two-tier memory (GCS event log + Cloud SQL/pgvector), a JEV judge cascade, and a design-time coverage matrix.

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| openrig | our nearest thing | verdict |
| project → mission → slice | `context_id` run → `TestPlan` → `TestScenario` → `TestStep` | the chain exists as data; links are one-directional and optional |
| intent composes up the chain | `Pack.summary_text()`, `plan-brief.md`, `implement-brief.md` | **composes DOWN only** — no leaf re-derives its parent's purpose |
| the fidelity law (deposit design inline) | `plan-brief.md` + the 5 plan lists | **we already do the right thing here** — and a known bug undoes it (§6.2) |
| Refocus channel | *nothing*; re-aiming needs a fresh `context_id` | **missing** |
| `LEARNED.md` / lore is path-identified | `common/learn` + pgvector recall | **we store the position and never route by it** (§6.3) |
| maturity ladder + stage vocabulary | `confidence` + `status` + `supersedes` | partial; `supersedes` is a dead field |
| drift as a first-class finding | `CoverageMatrix` gaps | **we only measure under-coverage** (§6.1) |
| CONTEXT-GAP / JUDGMENT-GAP | `TriageVerdict(message, verdict)` on *execution* failures | we triage failed runs, never failed *plans* |
| planning dial P0–P4 | `TPD_ASSURED_MAX_ITERS`, `TPD_LLM_DETAIL`, `depth=` | **numeric/binary env knobs, deployment-global** — not per piece |
| the brief is the unit | `plan-brief.md` + `implement-brief.md` | **we have this, and it's good** |
| the two locks | `approve` / `approve_plan` client-owned gates | **we have this, and it's good** |

Five of these need their evidence spelled out.

### The coverage matrix measures recall, never precision

`common/testplan/coverage.py` computes requirement × kind cells covered, code units reached, and a gap report. Every number answers *"what's missing?"* **No number anywhere answers "does this scenario serve anything?"** A scenario whose `source_refs` cite nothing, or cite an unresolvable ref, is silently absent from `covered` and nothing reports it.

We already learned this asymmetry on the gather side — `recall=1.0, precision=0.00` is a real state (complete-but-noisy), and reading only the leaked-node count hides it. We never ported the lesson downstream.

### The define→implement seam is "the deletion is silent", verbatim

Known behaviour: `define_plan(answer=…)` free-text corrections do not update the structured In-scope / Passed-means brief fields, so the plan keeps its initial narrow shape. That is exactly *"a dimension the owner holds and does not WRITE AND ROUTE is deleted from the product… the downstream agent invents a plausible replacement rather than raising a hand."*

The same seam produced the `effective_kinds` incident, still documented in that function's docstring: the implement fold-in collapsed `test_kinds` to `["performance"]` when it was empty, which under the old `test_kinds or defaults` **silently dropped happy/negative/boundary/error** and shipped a defaults-less suite. The fix was to make the union ADDITIVE — a hardcoded guard at one seam, not a general rule.

### We store the position and never route by it

`common/models/refine.py` `Insight` already carries `origin_step`, `scope`, `status`, `supersedes`, `rationale`, `confidence`, `source_refs`. That is most of openrig's lore frontmatter (`position`, `stage`, `method`, `date`) **already in our schema**.

But:

- `origin_step` is **write-only** — set in `capture.py`, projected into pg `meta`, asserted in two tests, and **read by no recall path**. `recall_lessons` filters on `source_refs ∩ seed_refs` and sorts by confidence/recency. The position is never consulted.

- `supersedes` is declared in the dataclass and referenced **nowhere else in** `src/`.

- Recall **copies the statement bytes** into `Pack.lessons` → `summary_text()`. openrig: *"An attachment never embeds or copies the lore bytes"* — an attachment is a pointer plus the owning position, resolved on demand under an explicit grant.

This is the concrete cause of the KGA memory-bleed (deployed `refine` asking ZIP-import questions for a *billing* ticket): lesson bytes earned at one position were composed into another position's context with no positional filter. Our response was B0–B6 — six statistical dampers (pack-scoped `run_id`, thin-seed parent climb, codegraph focus anchor, topic-coherence stop, IDF hub penalty, a structural grounding gate, exclude re-anchor).

openrig never needed any of them because lore is **path-scoped by construction**.

![[image-20260925-030409.png]]

### A live defect this review found: the semantic recall arm is dead

Applying the positional lens surfaced a real bug, not a design gap:

- `common/learn/capture.py:30` hardcodes `scope="context"` on **every** auto-captured lesson.

- The semantic leg of recall filters `scope='shared'` — `common/memory/pg/store.py:203` (`WHERE status='active' AND scope='shared' AND kind IN ('lesson','correction','gotcha')`) and `common/memory/vector_memory.py:204` (the same predicate).

- Nothing in `src/` ever writes `scope="shared"`. The only occurrence is a test fixture, `tests/test_index_projector.py:73`.

**Therefore the vector/semantic arm of** `recall_lessons` **cannot return an auto-captured lesson.** Only the structural arm (edge → `seed_refs`) can return anything. The generic `search` path is unaffected — it passes `scopes = ["context", "shared"]` — so this is specific to lesson *recall*.

One line to fix, but decide the semantics deliberately rather than flipping the default. `scope` is our `taxonomy`/privacy class, and openrig's answer is that crossing from position-local to shared is **an authored graduation event with a recorded warrant**, never a default. Making capture write `"shared"` would be exactly the laundering that convention forbids. The right fix is for recall's semantic leg to accept `("context", "shared")` like every other query, and to keep a real promotion path for anything that should go wider.

*(Live confirmation still wanted: the two-tier rollout recorded "cross-lingual recall proven", which likely exercised* `search_nodes` *or the structural arm. Worth re-checking against* `recall_lessons` *specifically before assuming the semantic leg ever fired in prod.)*

The `scope` field is one rung of a trust model openrig makes explicit and we only half-have. Their epistemic ladder is what `scope`, `confidence`, `status` and `supersedes` are each a fragment of — which is why two of those four fields are currently dead:

The mapping is closer than expected — `rationale` **is** openrig's warrant, and `status` is correctly a separate lifecycle axis from trust. The three gaps are that `confidence` is a flat grade rather than a ladder with promotion/demotion events, `scope` is hardcoded and never promoted, and `supersedes` is dead where openrig requires a successor pointer on anything superseded.

![[image-20260925-030128.png]]

## The debate

**Motion: adopt openrig's intent hierarchy and Refocus into test-agent-v2.**

### FOR

1.  **We have paid for drift twice, on the record** — the wrong-ticket refine bleed, and `recall=1.0 / precision=0.00` on LUZ-159312 where all five "grounded external-LLM leads" were cross-project AI/agent-framework meta pages. Both are "the lower unit stopped serving the higher intent."

2.  **The coverage matrix is half-built and we know which half.** Orphan/out-of-scope counters are an inverse index over data we already persist.

3.  **Our resumable paths are exactly openrig's failure case** (§6.5) — a hole in shipping code, not a hypothetical.

4.  **Most of the schema already exists.** `origin_step`, `scope`, `supersedes`, `rationale` are in `Insight` today. This is wiring, not modelling.

5.  **Fan-out makes it urgent** (§9).

#### AGAINST

1.  **openrig's altitudes are org-shaped; ours are artifact-shaped.** openrig has agents holding seats for days, and drift accrues because nobody re-reads. Our pipeline is one gated chain per ticket with a **client-owned human Yes/No at refine, approve, define_plan, approve_plan and implement_plan**. The human *is* the refocus channel and fires five times per run. Automating a refocus into a five-gate pipeline is ceremony.

2.  **Slice-intent on a Gherkin step is over-modelling** — and openrig's own SOP says so: *"If you're spending more time on the convention files or the audit than on the running product, stop and go build. Running the full apparatus on a small change is the letter-worship failure, not diligence."*

3.  **Naming it "Refocus" doesn't make it new.** Half of R2 is a reindex of `covered`. Say so in the diff, or we grow a subsystem where a function belongs.

4.  **Any refocus that costs an LLM call lands on an already-strained budget.** *(Corrected 2026-09-25: I3 — "implement = exactly one LLM call" — no longer holds. The* `TPD_ASSURED` *opt-in is gone, the assured loop is always on, and its own docstring states it trades I3 away: per round it costs* `ceil(in_scope_units / _BATCH_UNITS)` *generation batches plus* `TPD_JUDGE_SAMPLES` *judge calls, plus one scope-classify call per implement.)* The constraint that survives is the wall clock: three serial blocking Vertex calls already blew past Cloud Run's request timeout and killed an instance, and the loop now carries explicit budget guards for exactly that. A refocus must be deterministic, ride an existing call, or not exist.

5.  **The intent-sentence idea is wrong by openrig's own standard.** The fidelity law says a one-line intent is ~20:1 lossy. We already deposit the design inline via `plan-brief.md`. Adding a thin `TestPlan.intent` string would be the *anti-pattern* — and worse, it would invite downstream code to read the cheap field instead of the brief.

## The inversion — we can beat the mechanism we're copying

openrig's refocus is *self-asked*: three questions, and "discomfort on any of these is the signal." That is the right design for a harness that owns no judge, and it is honest about being unmeasurable.

**We own a calibrated judge.** JEV returns a bare `noul` float — P(true) — and already fronts failure triage in EXEC and the source gate in gather; the κ-calibration work exists precisely to make those numbers trustworthy.

So R2's upgrade path is not "add an LLM refocus." It is: once the deterministic orphan / out-of-scope counters exist and are reported, promote them to a **gated cascade** — `P(this scenario serves the plan intent)` through the JEV path we already ship, run **once per implement pass over the merged scenario set** (never per scenario, never per turn — the loop's wall-clock budget is already the binding constraint). Cheap deterministic filter first, judge only the residue. The same shape as every gate we already have.

**openrig asks the agent whether it has drifted. We can measure it.** That is the one place this comparison should end with us ahead.

![[image-20260925-031143.png]]

## Where the multi-agent risk actually lands

The prompt's framing — *"the more agents you have, the more scope creep could happen"* — is right, and it is worth being precise about where it bites.

**It does not bite scenario generation.** Phase-C worker fan-out (`TPD_GEN_MODE=workers`, Pub/Sub + Cloud Run workers; the coordinator splits the pack into per-batch jobs and merges results) fans out over *scenarios within one plan*. Every worker shares one intent. No divergence is possible.

**It bites gather.** Documented behaviour: sequential `gather_codebase(repo, ctx)` calls stop grounding once the exploration converges — the second repo returns 0 nodes and "budget/round-limit reached" — and the remedy is `repo=` up front or a **fresh context per repo**. That is literally *different builders, different intents, one shared context → noise*, with a context reset as the only cure.

So the forward-looking case for the intent chain is **multi-repo / multi-source parallel gather**, not plan generation. When a gather leg is dispatched per repo, each leg needs its own intent composing up to the run's — and openrig's answers apply directly: the brief is the unit, territories are exclusive, self-onboard from the routed reading list, then check the map against the ground. That is also the moment to revisit R5.

One caution from openrig on the multi-tester question specifically — do **not** hand each tester a narrow aperture on purpose:

> Agents inevitably narrow… **the narrowing IS the specialization effect** — the system's core mechanism, never a flaw to correct. Widening a specialist diffuses what made them elite. **Never set a narrow aperture intentionally**; seats arrive at theirs on their own. The ONLY aperture you ever steer is the wide one.

The corollary is their wire protocol, which is free and which our orchestrator violates whenever it over-specifies a worker prompt:

> Empowerment is delivered as **context, never as instructions** — in both directions. An orchestrator that converts context into step-by-step orders bypasses the builder's synthesis.
