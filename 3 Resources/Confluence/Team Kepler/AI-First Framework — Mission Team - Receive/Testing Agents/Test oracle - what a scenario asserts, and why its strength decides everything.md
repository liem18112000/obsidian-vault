# Test oracle - what a scenario asserts, and why its strength decides everything

*Confluence source · Team Kepler › AI-First Framework — Mission Team: Receive › Testing Agents › Agent Loop 3 - Test-Plan Definition › Evaluating the Test-Plan-Definition Agent · [view original](https://axonivy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TK/pages/49754570848/Test+oracle+-+what+a+scenario+asserts+and+why+its+strength+decides+everything) · updated 2026-09-15*

## **Purpose**

- One of the Layer-1 metrics is **Oracle Strength**, and it carries `0.15` of the Test-Plan Score — and stands in for fault detection until execution stage exists.

- That metric only makes sense if you know what a *test oracle* is.

- This page is the concept, grounded in how the Test-Plan-Definition agent (TPD) actually scores it.

### Sources

- **ISTQB Foundation syllabus** & **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119** — test oracle, expected results, test-design techniques.

- E. T. Barr et al., "The Oracle Problem in Software Testing: A Survey," *IEEE TSE* 2015 — the oracle taxonomy.

## What a test oracle is

A **test oracle** is the mechanism that

- Decides whether a test **passed or failed** — the source of the *expected* result the test compares the actual result against.

In a Gherkin scenario it is the `Then` step:

```
Given a credit-only invoice for an individual customer
When the invoice-run charge job executes
Then the tracking row reaches CREDIT_CARD_CHARGED_PENDING   ← this is the oracle
```

- Without an oracle a test can *run* but can't *judge* — it's a script, not a test.

- A test is only ever as good as its oracle: **the weakest link in test design is usually not "did we exercise the code?" but "did we assert the right thing?"**

**A test plan is a set of oracles.**

- For the TPD, the plan's scenarios/steps *are* the oracles — so grading the plan means grading what it would assert, not how many scenarios it produced.

## Why oracle *strength* is the whole game

Two scenarios can execute the exact same code path and one catches a regression while the other never will — the difference is the oracle:

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
|  | Oracle | On a real regression (charge silently fails) |
| **Weak** | `Then the response status is 2xx` | still 2xx → **test passes** → bug ships |
| **Strong** | `Then the tracking row reaches CREDIT_CARD_CHARGED_PENDING` | state never reached → **test fails** → bug caught |

A suite full of `assert 200` *looks* complete and green and catches almost nothing — the **execution-depth gap** the TPD hit against a real human-authored plan. So the metric must grade the **strength** of each oracle, not just its presence.

### How the TPD scores it (`metrics/oracle.py`)

Each step's `expected` string is classified into one of three tiers, deterministically, **without running anything**:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
| Tier | Weight | What it looks like | How it's detected |
| **strong** | **1.0** | a concrete, resolvable end-state — an enum/state token, or a value that matches the plan's own pass-criteria | an enum-shaped token `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{3,}` **or** any `pass_criteria` substring appears |
| **weak** | **0.0** | asserts only acceptance / a status code | contains a weak word: `2xx` `3xx` `4xx` `5xx` `status` `accepted` `succeeds` `is returned` `is processed` `is ready` `unchanged` `without error` `is rejected` |
| **medium** | **0.5** | anything in between | neither of the above |

>     if any(w in low for w in _WEAK):
>         return "weak"
>     return "medium"

> def oracle_strength(steps, pass_criteria=()) -> OracleScore:
>     graded = [(e, classify(e, pass_criteria)) for s in steps if (e := s.get("expected"))]
>     dist  = {k: sum(t == k for _, t in graded) for k in ("strong", "medium", "weak")}
>     score = sum(_WEIGHT[t] for _, t in graded) / len(graded) if graded else 0.0
>     return OracleScore(round(score, 3), dist, sorted({e for e, t in graded if t == "weak"}))

> `oracle_strength` returns a typed `OracleScore(score, distribution, weak)`:

>
> - Feeding the plan's own `pass_criteria` in means a step that asserts the plan's declared "passed means…" end-state scores **strong** even if it isn't enum-shaped.

### Where it lands — the TPS and the mutation connection

- **In the score:**

  - `oracle_strength` is `0.15` of the Test-Plan Score

  - `TPS = 0.30·fault_detection + 0.25·brief_groundedness + 0.20·coverage + 0.15·oracle_strength + 0.10·trajectory`.

- **As a proxy for fault detection:**

  - the truest measure of a suite is its **mutation score** — inject faults into the system and count how many the suite kills.

  - That needs the tests to *run* (the not-yet-built execution stage / Pillar 2 of `RESEARCH-test-executor-agent.md`).

  - Until then, **oracle strength is the deterministic stand-in**: a strong oracle kills many mutants, a weak one kills almost none, so oracle strength is a strong *predictor* of mutation score — and it's measurable now, without running anything.

  - When real mutation lands it replaces the proxy in the `fault_detection` term and oracle strength stays as its own signal.

### A note on oracle types (testing science)

The classic taxonomy — the TPD's oracles are the **specified / end-state** kind:

- **Specified oracle** — expected output comes from the spec/AC ("passed means the invoice status is X"). *What the TPD's* `pass_criteria`*-matched strong oracles are.*

- **Derived / consistency oracle** — expected output derived from another run or an invariant (e.g. "the total is unchanged after a read-only call").

- **Metamorphic oracle** — no known exact answer, but a *relation* between inputs/outputs must hold.

- **Human oracle** — a person judges. Expensive; the thing an agentic plan is trying to reduce reliance on.

The TPD deliberately rewards **specified end-state** oracles because they are the ones a downstream automated executor can check and the ones that actually discriminate — which is why `assert 200` scores `0.0` and a named end-state scores `1.0`.
