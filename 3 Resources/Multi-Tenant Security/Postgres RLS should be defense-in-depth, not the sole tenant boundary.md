# Postgres RLS should be defense-in-depth, not the sole tenant boundary

Relying on PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS keyed on `current_setting('app.tenant_id')`) as the *only* tenant boundary is fragile, because common layers sit outside or above it and silently defeat it:

- a response/read cache in front of the DB returns cached rows without RLS ever running;
- a table created without a `tenant_id` column (and no policy) is unprotected;
- setting `app.tenant_id` from caller-supplied input aims RLS at the attacker's chosen tenant;
- connecting as a superuser or the table-owner role bypasses RLS unless `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is set (and even FORCE does not stop `BYPASSRLS`/superusers).

Lesson: treat RLS as defense-in-depth. Also enforce tenant scoping explicitly at the application layer (query filters, cache keys, authorization checks), and run the app as a non-superuser role.
