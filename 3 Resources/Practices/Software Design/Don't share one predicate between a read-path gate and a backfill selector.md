# Don't share one predicate between a read-path gate and a backfill selector

When a feature adds a per-document field that only a background **backfill** needs (e.g. `_shard` for parallel-count fan-out), do NOT add a "field is missing" clause for it to the predicate that already answers **"is this tenant fully migrated?"** if that same predicate also gates the **read path**.

In luz_docs the `buildUnmaterializedFilter()` (OR of missing `_isPublic` / `_effectiveSecurityClassCodes` / `_folderNames`) had two callers:
- `isMaterialized()` → drives `shouldUseMaterialized()` → gates the **entire** materialized (fast) read path.
- the migration backfill → selects documents to (re)stamp.

Adding `missing _shard` to that one filter looked like a clean one-liner, but it would have flipped every already-materialized tenant to "incomplete" and silently reverted the whole read path to the slow legacy path until a full re-backfill finished. Wrong altitude.

**Fix:** split the predicate. Keep the read-path gate on the original sentinels; give the backfill its own filter that *also* selects docs missing the new field. The backfill then stamps the field on legacy docs without ever touching the readiness gate.

**General rule:** if one predicate answers both *"is the feature ready? (read path)"* and *"what still needs migrating? (backfill)"*, treat that as a smell. A field that only the migration cares about belongs only in the migration selector — split the two definitions rather than overloading the shared one.
