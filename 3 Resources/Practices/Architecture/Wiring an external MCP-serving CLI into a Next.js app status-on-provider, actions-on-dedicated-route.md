# Wiring an external MCP-serving CLI into a Next.js app: status-on-provider, actions-on-dedicated-route

Design decision (Vinnstack Polaris integration plan, 2026-07-14): when embedding an external CLI that serves content over an MCP tunnel (e.g. Polaris), split the wiring along a clean seam:

- **Shared CLI shim** — one module (`lib/account/polarisCli.ts`) owns bin resolution, tunnel tcp-probe, the bounded `run()` spawn, and an in-flight `Map` guard so two concurrent identical actions (e.g. double-clicking 'Turn on') share one child process. Everything else calls the shim.
- **Status stays on the existing provider card; mutations + content get a dedicated route.** Reuse the already-cached `GET /api/auth/<provider>` for status (don't overload the generic provider route with provider-specific verbs like up/down/bootstrap). Put those under a new `/api/polaris/**` tree.
- **Cache reads, never mutations.** `createTtlCache` (60s) for list/status reads; up/down/bootstrap always run fresh and invalidate the cache after.
- **Degrade honestly with sentinels, not empty results.** Tunnel down → return a typed `{ tunnelDown: true }` so the UI can offer 'Turn on', instead of an empty list that reads as 'no content'. CLI absent → install hint. A config kill-switch (`polarisEnabled=false`) short-circuits every new path — the single rollback lever.
- **Guard the hot paths behind an opt-in.** Edits to the agent runner / system-prompt builder only fire when a Polaris agent is explicitly selected, so default behavior is byte-identical (zero regression) and provable by diffing the spawned argv.

Why: keeps the integration additive and reversible, avoids a second parallel status-polling path, and makes 'off' the safe default. Full plan: `doc/polaris-mcp-implementation-plan.md`.
