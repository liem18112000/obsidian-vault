# Bitmap/HLL counts supersede fan-out; they don't combine with it

A slow security-facing visible-document count (`count where _isPublic OR _effectiveSecurityClassCodes intersects user.codes`) is slow because of **amplification**: a multikey `$in` produces one index entry per (doc x matching code), and counting DISTINCT docs needs a dedup scan. Work scales with the (doc x code) entries, not the answer.

Two ways to attack it, and they are NOT complementary:
- **Fan-out (K _shard buckets, run concurrently)** only PARALLELIZES the amplified scan across cores. Same total work, less wall-clock. Ceiling ~= number of executor threads (measured floor ~3s on a 6-thread pool, non-sharded replica set).
- **Bitmaps (Roaring, exact) / HyperLogLog (approx)** REMOVE the amplification: precompute one set per security code, union (OR / register-max) the users codes at query time, then popcount/estimate. That is sub-millisecond regardless of doc count.

Key consequence: bitmaps/HLL make the count sub-ms, which makes fan-out **redundant** for the read — they REPLACE it, they do not "join" K to boost it. Once the scan is gone there is nothing for K to parallelize. So pick a ceiling: keep fan-out (~3s, tiny isolated change) OR go Roaring (~ms, but a write-path + storage project: per-code bitmaps + ObjectId->ordinal dictionary + persistence).

Gotchas:
- A random `_shard` int (uniform in [0,2^30)) can NOT double as Roarings dense ordinal — it is sparse/collidable; you still need the ObjectId<->ordinal dictionary.
- You CANNOT precompute a single per-doc `_isVisible` flag, because visibility depends on the QUERYING users code set, not a fixed property. That per-user union is exactly what bitmaps solve and why index-coverage alone does not remove the amplification for the multi-code `$in`.
- HLL is mergeable and tiny but APPROXIMATE (+/-1-2%); for a security count an under-count is access-leak-shaped, so HLL is only safe for a cosmetic badge.
