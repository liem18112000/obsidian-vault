# Concurrency-bound single-primary Mongo reads: indexes stop helping; recognize by bimodal latency

When a workload is **concurrency-bound on a single Mongo primary**, adding indexes stops helping — the bottleneck is the number of simultaneous heavy reads contending for one node's CPU / WiredTiger cache / IO, not the cost of any one query.

**Diagnostic signature (how to recognize it):**
- **Bimodal latency** — the same query is fast in isolation but ~3× slower whenever it overlaps others, with no middle band. Fast-vs-slow split, not a spread. (eArchive: aggregate ~2.5 s isolated vs ~8 s overlapping; slow ops outnumbered fast ~2:1.)
- **Median invariant to index suite** — p50 barely moves (or worsens) as you add indexes; more/larger index trees shrink cache and can push it disk-bound.
- **High stddev ≈ mean** on the heavy endpoints; CPU near container ceiling.
- **Fan-out** — count ops-per-request (sweep-line over `[end − time-consuming, end]` intervals from access logs gives max-concurrent). One eArchive page = ~12 concurrent security aggregates to `readPreference=primary`.

**Why index is the wrong lever:** an index reduces *per-op* docs-examined; it does nothing about N ops queueing for one node.

**Levers that actually help:** cut fan-out (coalesce N aggregates into 1); precompute/cache the result (serve off materialized fields or luz_cache instead of re-aggregating); spread reads with `secondaryPreferred`; bulkhead/semaphore heavy ops; size WiredTiger cache to hold the hot working set.

**To prove it directly:** hold index state fixed, vary only concurrency (1 vs 5 vs 10 parallel) — if p50 climbs with concurrency while single-user stays flat, it's concurrency-bound.
