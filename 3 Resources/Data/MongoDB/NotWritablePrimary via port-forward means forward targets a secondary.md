# NotWritablePrimary via port-forward means forward targets a secondary

Writes over a `kubectl port-forward` to a Mongo pod failing with error **10107 `NotWritablePrimary`** ("not primary", errorLabels `RetryableWriteError`) mean the forward targets a **SECONDARY**. `localhost:27017` is whatever single pod you forwarded and the driver is pinned to it by `directConnection=true`, so it cannot fail over — and `readPreference=primary` in the URI changes nothing. Reads still succeed (stats scripts pass), which is why a *reused* "localhost:27017 already reachable" forward is the classic trap.

Fix — ask the replica set who is primary, then forward that pod on a fresh port:

```bash
kubectl exec <any-rs-pod> -n dev-mongodb-clusters -- mongo --quiet --eval "db.isMaster().primary"
# equivalently: db.command({hello:1}).primary  → primary's pod DNS name
kubectl port-forward <primary-pod> 27017:27017 -n dev-mongodb-clusters
```

The primary moves on failover — always re-probe, never hardcode a pod (as of 2026-07-22 luz-mongodb01 primary = rs-0). The `earchive-*` skills automate this with an insert+drop probe. Tenant-db auth convention on dev Luz mongo: `user = pass = authSource = db = tenantId`.
