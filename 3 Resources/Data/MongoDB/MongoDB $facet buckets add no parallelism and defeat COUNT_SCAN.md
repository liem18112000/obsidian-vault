# MongoDB $facet buckets add no parallelism and defeat COUNT_SCAN

When parallelizing a slow MongoDB count by `_shard` ranges on a non-sharded replica set, the speedup comes ONLY from running M **concurrent** count operations (M connections -> Mongo gives each its own thread, scanning disjoint ranges in parallel). 

Packing N sub-counts into ONE aggregation via `$facet` (e.g. M threads each doing a facet of N -> K=M*N buckets) does NOT help latency:
- A `$facet` scans its input stream ONCE and fans each doc to the N facet counters in memory. The N split is cheap in-memory bucketing, not extra parallelism and not less scan. So one facet-of-N call ~= one plain count of that super-range. K=M*N behaves like K=M.

Two real but secondary effects of the facet approach:
- GOOD: fewer round-trips (M calls instead of K) -> less connection/`connection=close` overhead and less downstream load amplification (fewer jsonstore/Mongo calls per user count -> fewer 503/fail-loud).
- BAD: `$facet` must materialize docs to bucket them -> forces IXSCAN+FETCH, which DEFEATS the count-only `COUNT_SCAN` fast path. So $facet fights an index-covered count: once the predicate is covered, M plain `count`s beat a facet.

Corollary: the real sub-2s lever for a scan-bound count is making the scan cheap (cover the predicate so a plain `count` is a COUNT_SCAN) or caching it — NOT more buckets and NOT $facet. Also note `countDocuments` runs an aggregation (fetches) while the legacy `count` command can use COUNT_SCAN.
