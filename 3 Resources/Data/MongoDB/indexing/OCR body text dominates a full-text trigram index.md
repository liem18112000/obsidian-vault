# OCR body text dominates a full-text trigram index

When a substring trigram field concatenates both metadata (title, fileName, sender, subject, tags) and a **full OCR body** (`documentTextContent`), the **body dominates** the index. Metadata fields yield only tens-to-low-hundreds of distinct trigrams per doc; a multi-paragraph OCR body saturates **thousands**.

Measured in luz_docs @512k docs: `idx_trigrams` = 5.6 GB = **~98% of all index storage**, ~linear at ~11 MB / 1 000 docs, driven almost entirely by the body.

**Design consequence:** treat the body as the expensive, optional part. Either drop it from the trigram blob (metadata-only), isolate it in a separate field+index so the hot metadata path stays tiny and body search is flag-gated, or bound it via [[Bounded bucketed hashing caps trigram index entries per document]] / length-cap. Don't let body trigrams ride in the same always-on field as metadata.
