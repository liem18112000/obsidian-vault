# Mongo unique-index insert as CAS when the cache has no putIfAbsent

When the shared cache offers only get/put/delete (no putIfAbsent/CAS — e.g. luz_cache), a reliable distributed lock can still be built from **MongoDB unique-index rejection**: `insertOne` a lock document with a deterministic `_id` (e.g. the tenant id) into a lock collection — exactly one concurrent inserter succeeds, the rest get duplicate-key errors and know they lost. Release = delete after publishing the result; add a TTL index as the crash-recovery lease.

Gotchas:
- Get-then-insert (the `findOrCreate` shape, e.g. `MigrationCampaignService.findOrCreate` in luz_docs) is NOT atomic — two racers both see absent and both insert unless the unique index rejects the second. The atomicity lives in the index, never in the read-check.
- Through a REST facade (jsonstore) each acquire costs a network roundtrip and a per-tenant collection; fine for per-cold-window locks, wrong for per-request hot paths.
- The duplicate-key error IS the signal — catch it as the loser branch, do not treat it as a failure to retry.
