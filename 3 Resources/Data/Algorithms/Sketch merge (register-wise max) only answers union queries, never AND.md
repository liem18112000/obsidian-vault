title: Sketch merge (register-wise max) only answers union queries, never AND
type: lesson

# Sketch merge (register-wise max) only answers union queries, never AND

Two HLL (or similar cardinality) sketches combine by element-wise `max()` over their register arrays. That yields the cardinality of the **UNION**, never the intersection.

**Why:** each register holds the longest rare-streak seen by anything that landed in it, so the pooled group's longest streak *is* the max of the two — that's exactly what merging computes. But the max discards *which* sketch contributed each winner, so nothing in the merged registers can tell you how many items were in both sets.

**Consequence for query planning:** `folder = F123 OR tag = invoice` is answerable by merging the folder and tag sketches. `folder = F123 AND tag = invoice` is **not** — an AND needs a different structure entirely: an exact Roaring-bitmap AND over per-dimension bitmaps, or a Jaccard-similarity-based estimator for an approximate intersection.

**Rule:** whenever a design says "precompute per-dimension sketches and combine at query time", check the boolean combinator first — OR is merge-safe, AND is not. (This exact error shipped in a luz_docs count-estimate diagram before being corrected.)
