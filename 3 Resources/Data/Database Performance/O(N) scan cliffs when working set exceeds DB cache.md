# O(N) scan cliffs when working set exceeds DB cache

A linear-time DB scan/count (O(N) — visit every matched index entry) has a **per-item constant that is not constant**: it depends on whether the page is already in the DB's RAM cache (e.g. MongoDB WiredTiger). RAM hit ~100 ns; disk (SSD) miss ~100 µs — a ~1000× gap. While the working set fits cache, every access is a RAM hit → shallow slope. Once the working set exceeds cache, the DB evicts and re-reads pages from disk (thrashing) → the per-item cost climbs toward the disk number → latency **cliffs** at the threshold. Same O(N), constant multiplied by the cache-miss penalty — not a complexity change.

**Diagnostic signature: CPU collapses while latency explodes.** Cache-resident work is CPU-bound (cores busy comparing in-RAM keys, ~full cores). Disk-bound work leaves cores idle waiting on I/O → CPU drops to near zero. So *low CPU + high latency = working-set-exceeds-cache*, not a code regression.

**Corollary — thread-level parallelism stops helping past the cliff.** Splitting the scan across K threads only parallelises CPU work; K threads all issue reads into the *same* disk queue and contend, so fan-out gives no speedup once disk-bound. (Real parallelism past the cliff needs sharding across machines, each holding its slice in its own cache.)

**Fixes keep the constant small (don't change O(N)):** more cache RAM / bigger node so the set stays resident; a leaner/covering index (more entries per cached page → threshold pushed out); or shard so each node caches only its slice. To truly beat O(N) you must precompute (maintained counters), not scan.

Observed concretely in LUZ-154613 count benchmark: 720k docs = 11.5 s (~16 µs/doc, CPU-bound, ~4 cores) → 960k = 116 s (~125 µs/doc, CPU <250 m) — an ~8× per-doc jump = the disk penalty. See [[reference_count_fanout_K_benchmark]] (memory), and the count-fanout benchmark report.
