# Relocating docker-compose.yml renames the Compose project and orphans volumes

Docker Compose derives the **project name** from the directory of the compose file (unless overridden). So moving `docker-compose.yml` from the repo root into a subfolder like `dockers/` silently changes the project name (e.g. `accesstrade_integration` → `dockers`), which **renames every named volume and network** (`accesstrade_integration_atdata` → `dockers_atdata`). Compose then creates fresh, EMPTY volumes and the old data is orphaned — a nasty surprise for a stateful service (a SQLite DB on a named volume just "vanishes").

**Fix:** pin a top-level `name:` in the compose file so the project identity is stable no matter where the file lives:

```yaml
name: accesstrade-integration
services:
  ...
```

Discovered while splitting one Dockerfile into purpose-built web/mcp/cli images under a `dockers/` folder. See [[Docker Compose path resolution env_file vs build context vs dockerfile]] for the relative-path rules that bite at the same time.
