# Two Dockerfiles differing only in entrypoint should be one image plus compose override

Decision (2026-07-03): merged `Dockerfile.puller` into the single connector `Dockerfile`. The separate puller image existed only because it alone needed boto3; once the main connector grew S3 paths of its own (`APPSFLYER_RAW_STORE=s3` raw landing, `APPSFLYER_CDP_STORE=s3` JSONL store), both images needed `pip install ".[puller]"` and became identical except for the entrypoint. Pattern: when two Dockerfiles differ only in ENTRYPOINT, keep ONE image and expose the second CLI as another docker-compose service with an `entrypoint:` override (both services share `image:` + `build:` so compose builds once). Cuts image-maintenance in half and keeps the two CLIs version-locked.
