# Publish every CI build via a rolling latest pre-release on GitHub

GitHub Releases must hang off a tag, so you cannot attach a build asset to "a commit on master" directly. The standard pattern for making every default-branch build publicly downloadable is a rolling pre-release on a fixed tag (conventionally `latest`), while real version tags keep their own permanent releases:

```yaml
- uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') && github.ref_name || 'latest' }}
    prerelease: ${{ !startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') }}
    files: app.zip
```

action-gh-release reuses the existing `latest` release and replaces same-named assets, so the download URL stays stable and always serves the newest build. The `a && b || c` expression is the GitHub Actions idiom for ternary (safe while `b` is truthy).

Caveat: on subsequent runs the `latest` tag itself keeps pointing at the commit that first created the release — only the assets are refreshed. If the tag must track HEAD, delete the release+tag before re-publishing.
