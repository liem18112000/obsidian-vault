# GitHub Actions continue-on-error: step-level goes green, job-level stays red

GitHub Actions `continue-on-error: true` behaves differently depending on where you put it, and the difference is a UX gotcha:

- **Step-level** (`jobs.<j>.steps[*].continue-on-error`): if that step fails, it is treated as **success** for the job outcome — the step shows a warning but the **job goes green**. Use this when you want a flaky/optional step (e.g. an advisory AI review that can hit a 429 / exhausted quota) to be *skipped cleanly* with no red anywhere.
- **Job-level** (`jobs.<j>.continue-on-error`): a failing job no longer fails the **overall workflow run**, but the **job itself still shows as failed (red)** in the UI.

So "make this error just skip and not look broken" = **step-level**. "Let this whole job fail without failing the run" = job-level.

Concretely: for an advisory `run-gemini-cli` step that errors on `TerminalQuotaError` (HTTP 429, free-tier daily limit), put `continue-on-error: true` on the **step** so the gemini-review/gemini jobs stay green.
