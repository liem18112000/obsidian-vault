# GKE log FRESHNESS window gets swamped by noise on high-traffic clusters

On a high-traffic GKE workload, `gcloud logging read` with a relative FRESHNESS window (e.g. `30m`) and a LIMIT can silently return a much narrower time slice than expected, because the API returns the newest N entries within that freshness window, newest-first -- if the container logs faster than LIMIT/FRESHNESS entries per second, the returned batch never reaches back to the time you actually care about.

Concrete case: luz-docs on the performance cluster emits roughly 1300 log lines/sec (verbose per-line JsonStoreLoggingFilter/ClientResponseFilter logging, one entry per HTTP call plus one per stack-trace line on exceptions). A `FRESHNESS=20m LIMIT=3000` query returned entries spanning only 2.3 *seconds* of real time, nowhere near the target window from ~13 minutes earlier.

Fix: when you need logs from a SPECIFIC past window (e.g. correlating with a test run's timestamps), bypass relative freshness and query `gcloud logging read` directly with explicit `timestamp>="..." AND timestamp<="..."` bounds and `--order=asc`, plus a `textPayload:"<narrowing substring>"` filter to cut noise -- don't rely on FRESHNESS+LIMIT to reach back on a chatty container.
