# Creating the GSA a KSA annotation references activates WI routing and can break a pod

On a GKE cluster with Workload Identity enabled, creating the Google service account (GSA) that a Kubernetes SA's `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account` annotation *references* can silently BREAK a running pod. Before the GSA exists the annotation is a dangling reference; the moment the GSA exists, the GKE metadata server starts routing the pod's token requests (`service-accounts/default/token`) to that GSA — and if there is no `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` binding letting the KSA impersonate it, every token request fails with `metadata ... token ... not defined`. Symptom: sidecars that were working (e.g. Cloud SQL Auth Proxy) suddenly cannot authenticate.

**Lesson:** WI is all-or-nothing — annotation + GSA + workloadIdentityUser binding must all be present together. Adding the GSA without the binding is worse than having no GSA. On a WI-enabled cluster the node-SA fallback is also disabled, so a pod with a dangling/incomplete WI setup gets NO Google credentials at all.
