# FastAPI request-size guards inside the handler run after the body is in RAM

A size/quantity guard written inside a FastAPI handler (e.g. `if len(payload.events) > N: raise 413`) runs only *after* Pydantic has already parsed and materialized the entire request body in memory. It cannot prevent the OOM it appears to guard against.

Enforce a request-body-size cap at the server/ingress layer (uvicorn/Starlette limit, or the reverse proxy) so oversized bodies are rejected before they are buffered. The in-handler count check is still useful for a clean 413, but it is not a memory-safety control.
