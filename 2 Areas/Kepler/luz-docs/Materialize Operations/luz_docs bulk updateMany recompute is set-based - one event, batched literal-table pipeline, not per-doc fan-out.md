# luz_docs bulk updateMany recompute is set-based - one event, batched literal-table pipeline, not per-doc fan-out

A tracked `updateMany` touching materialize trigger fields must NOT fan out N per-doc recompute events (~3N round trips: reload + recompute + re-stamp each). luz_docs instead fires **one** `BulkDocumentChangeEvent` carrying the pre-matched ids (no per-doc diff — bulk reactions recompute from current truth, so a diff would be unused), and `DocBulkMaterializeObserver` recomputes **set-based** per batch of `BULK_RECOMPUTE_BATCH` (200) ids:

1. one projected read of the batch docs → distinct folderIds,
2. one folder prefetch (`loadFoldersById`),
3. one `updateMany {_id: {$in: batch}}` with a literal-table pipeline that rebuilds ALL FOUR sentinels — including `_folderNames` via an id→name table, which the parent-change cascade deliberately skips but a bulk `folderIds` change invalidates.

Constant round trips per batch regardless of N; batching bounds both the `$in` and the inlined tables far below the 16 MB command cap.

Correctness props: `$range` input is `$ifNull`-guarded so docs without `folderIds` degrade to empty arrays (the by-id filter, unlike `{folderIds: {$in: ...}}`, does not guarantee the field exists — raw `$size` would WriteError); a 207 from `updateManyByFilter` (matched != modified) is swallowed as benign — Mongo does not count an update that produces an identical doc as modified, so already-correct sentinels are expected, not a partial failure; the find→updateMany window is the same accepted race as single-op tracking; idempotent recompute + @Retry converge.
