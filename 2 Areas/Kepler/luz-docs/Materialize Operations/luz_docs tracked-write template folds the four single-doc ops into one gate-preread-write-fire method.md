# luz_docs tracked-write template folds the four single-doc ops into one gate-preread-write-fire method

luz_docs `TrackingJsonStoreClient` folds its four tracked single-doc writes (insert/replace/update/delete) into one template method instead of four copies of the same flow:

```java
private Response tracked(String collection, Set<String> touchedFields, Supplier<JsonObject> beforeReader,
                         Supplier<Response> write, BiConsumer<JsonObject, Response> onSuccess)
```

Flow: gate (untracked collection / suppression / untouched fields) -> optional pre-read -> write -> fire-and-forget `onSuccess(before, response)` inside the never-throw `track()` wrapper. Null is the skip signal: `touchedFields == null` means "whole document may change, collection membership alone gates" (replace, delete); `beforeReader == null` means "no before state" (insert). The write `Supplier` is the single source for both the bypass and tracked branches — previously every method spelled the raw client call twice, which is the bug surface this removes (branches drifting apart). Plain JDK `Supplier`/`BiConsumer`, no custom functional interface.
