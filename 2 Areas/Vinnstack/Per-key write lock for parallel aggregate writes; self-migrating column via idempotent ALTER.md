# Per-key write lock for parallel aggregate writes; self-migrating column via idempotent ALTER

Two store patterns from adding parallel process-flow generation + a new column to Vinnstack (2026-07):

**1. Per-key write lock for aggregate stores.** `setStoryFlow` (and every writer in interrogationStore) does getInterrogation -> mutate in memory -> saveInterrogation, and saveInterrogation DELETE+reinserts the whole epic aggregate (questions/prds/stories). So two concurrent writes to the SAME epic each read a stale snapshot and the last save clobbers the other = lost update. "Generate ALL flows in parallel" fires many setStoryFlow for one epic, hitting exactly this. Fix without refactoring persistence: a per-epic in-memory promise-chain mutex — `withEpicLock(epic, fn)` chains each call after the previous settles, keyed by epic so different epics never block. The slow LLM runs still overlap; only the fast save is serialized. Works because the in-process Next server is the single writer. General rule: any read-modify-write of a whole aggregate is unsafe under concurrency — serialize per aggregate key or switch to targeted column upserts.

**2. Self-migrating column.** Vinnstack applies db/schema.sql only via manual migrate scripts, so adding a column to a live DB normally needs an ops step. To avoid that: a memoized `ensureSchemaExtensions()` in the store runs `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ...` once per process (idempotent), awaited at the top of getInterrogation/saveInterrogation. The column also goes in schema.sql (CREATE TABLE + the same idempotent ALTER) for fresh DBs. Net: an existing DB gains the column on first access, no separate migration run.
