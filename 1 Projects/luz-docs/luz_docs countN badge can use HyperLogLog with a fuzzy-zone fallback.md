# luz_docs count>N badge can use HyperLogLog with a fuzzy-zone fallback

For luz_docs (Kepler), the question was whether a `count(query) > N` UI badge (e.g. flipping to "999+") could use a HyperLogLog sketch to stay under a 500ms target even at 128k+ docs.

Decision: HLL is a legitimate fit for this *cosmetic* threshold badge, but only under two conditions:

1. **The predicate must decompose into a small, fixed set of precomputed dimensions** (folder id, tag, security-class code, `_isPublic`) — each maintained as its own HLL sketch, updated O(1) per write (same write-path pattern already used for `_isPublic`/`_effectiveSecurityClassCodes`/`_shard` in the materialize pipeline). A merged HLL only answers "how many docs are in the union of these precomputed sketches" — it cannot handle an arbitrary/ad hoc/free-text filter, because you can't precompute a sketch per every string a user might type, and building one at query time costs the same scan you were trying to avoid. Ad hoc full-text counts need an index ($text or trigram field), not a sketch.

2. **The estimate-vs-N comparison must use a fuzzy zone**, not a raw point comparison — see [[HyperLogLog error in the small-range (linear-counting) regime]] for why a single estimate can't safely decide a close boundary. E.g.: estimate < 0.95N -> show as-is; estimate > 1.05N -> show "N+"; in between -> fall back to an exact capped count (`limit: N+1`).

This is a narrowing of an existing, already-decided rule in the luz_docs codebase (see docs/bitmap-count-investigation.md and docs/perf-LUZ-154613-count-scaling-findings-and-solution.md): HLL is explicitly *rejected* for the security-facing visible-document count, because its ~1-2% error is access-leak-shaped (could under-count and hide a document a user should see, or the reverse). A cosmetic ">999" display badge is a different, lower-stakes question than "can this user see this document" — that's what makes HLL acceptable here when it wasn't for the security count.
